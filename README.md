What if you could just CHOOSE your YouTube layout? Well, now you can!

Available as a Firefox extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/customtube/

Chrome version is submitted for review.

CustomTube does not collect user data. I don't even know how to program that and I wouldn't want to anyway.

CustomTube shares a small amount of code with YouTube Redux, namely the code for managing user settings, and the code for resizing the video player.
